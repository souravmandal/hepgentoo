ThePEG project is a toolkit for providing a common platform for using and building event generators in C++.  ThePEG has been broken out from the PYTHIA7 program to better factorize the parts which were PYTHIA-specific from those which are general model-independent components of the toolkit and which can be used by any event generator model.
